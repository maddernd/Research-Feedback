title: Reading BOM Data
---

Extend on from our temperature program to read in full data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM).


Previously we have use control flow to read in each of the values from a file to calculate an average temperature. In this video we will look at downloading temperature data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). This data comes in a comma separated format (CSV) which we can process using arrays and the `Split` method from the `String` class. Make use of loops, arrays, and lists to read in and process this data.

## Your Task

Find a station with some data, and let us know what its average temperature is.

Let us know in the comments.
