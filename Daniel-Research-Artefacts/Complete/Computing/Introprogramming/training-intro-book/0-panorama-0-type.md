This chapter is all about **types**, so its is important to have a good understanding of what a type is. A type is a specification for data, describing how it is stored and interpreted.

:::note

- A Type is a kind of **building block**, describing the format and interpretation of values.
- Types specify the following:
  - The size (number of bits) needed to store a value of this type.
  - How the bits of the type are interpreted.
  - The operations that can be performed on values of this type.
- You can think of a type as a blueprint, specifying how data for this type is laid out in memory.
- The interpretation of a value depends on its type, for example `10100101` is `Ã‘` if the value is a character type, but the same value would be `165` if it is an integer type.
- You can create your own types...
