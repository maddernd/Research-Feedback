Now that you have the process of compiling, the basic structure for a C/C++ program, and the related coding conventions, the next step is to explore the different statements the language has. Like we have seen in C#, this will include statements to create variables, call other blocks of code, and to control the flow of instructions within the computer.

Let's work through each of these different statements one at a time and see the syntax and an example in C/C++.
