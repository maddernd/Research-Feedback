We have seen a lot in our journey so far -- the different instructions, how they work within the computer, and how we can start to put these together in order to create small programs.

To wrap up this part, we will stop and look in more detail at putting these concepts into action. The goal of this chapter is to bring together what we have seen and build a small program.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter you should be able to:

- Plan out small algorithms.
- Explain factors that go into making code easy to read.
- Make effective use of your code editor.
