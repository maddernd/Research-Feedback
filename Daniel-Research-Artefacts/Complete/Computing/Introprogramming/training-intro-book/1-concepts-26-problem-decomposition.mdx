title: Problem Decomposition

Discover a basic approach to tackling any large problem, and see how it applies to software development.

Software development is challenging, as we are creating instructions that an unintelligent machine will follow to the letter. This means you must be very precise, and the instructions must be very detailed. As a result, software projects are often large and complicated. To help tackle this we need a general approach to dealing with large problems.

The approach we used is known as **problem decomposition**, and the idea can be traced back to work from Ren√© Descartes' _Discourse on the Method_. In this, Descartes proposed an approach to solve scientific problems that were too difficult for him to approach otherwise. His idea was to **break down** any problem down into simple parts; things that are small and easy to understand. He then worked on the simple parts, and re-built his understanding, little by little, and as it were piece by piece to the knowledge of the greater problem.

Descartes' approach was designed with the aim to developing scientific understanding, but the idea applies to any large project. When approaching a large problem, break it down into parts. If these parts are still too large, break them down further until each part is small, simple, and easy to solve. Solve the parts, and the final solution is then reconstructed from these parts.

## Software Decomposition

As we know, software is broken down into a number of artefacts. These artefacts allow us to break problems down into small components, giving us the mechanism by which we can solve larger problems.

With object oriented programs, we divide the solution to classes that define the roles that objects play. These roles are further broken down into the _actions_ and _knowledge_ for these roles.

Good software engineering practice recommends that methods should be small, with a singular purpose. This helps ensure that we break problems down into parts that are part that are "small and easy to understand". Together with appropriate naming, this allows us to build up large software solutions.

Packaging mechanisms such as libraries and frameworks then allow us to reuse components that others have developed. This saves us from having to re-build basic functionality, and allows us to focus on creating new and creative solutions.

## Your Task

Thinking about the software you want to create, how would you go about breaking it into parts? Could you apply these concepts to other large projects?
