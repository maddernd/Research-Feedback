Go back over the sequence and data chapter and review the syntax diagrams. Check these against the code you have already created. You should now be able to connect the ideas from the diagrams with the code you have created.

You do not need to spend long on this chapter. Move on to the next chapter where you can start using these ideas as you learn about control flow.
