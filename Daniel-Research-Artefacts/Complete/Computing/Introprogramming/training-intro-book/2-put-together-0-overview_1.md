Control flow gives us a whole range of opportunities to create dynamic and interactive programs. In this chapter we explored several control flow concepts, and it may take you some time to understand them. That's okay! We encourage you to put in the time and effort now to really understand how to **use** these ideas.

This section will guide you through the process of applying these ideas across two different programs. Here your focus should be on the way you think and approach problems, and the ways in which the different control flow mechanisms can come together to produce different effects.

First, we revisit the change calculator. We will look at using control flow mechanisms to:

* allow the user to calculate and give change multiple times,
* perform validations to ensure the program does not crash, and
* reduce duplication of logic within the code.

The second example will explore the use of control flow concepts to build a small game. This will build a program from the ground up across several iterations.

Throughout this section we will focus on the concepts and how to use them to design programs. You will need to combine these ideas with the syntax details from earlier pages to build the programs yourself. If you get stuck, you can check your work against the code in the [wrap up](../../5-wrapup/0-wrapup) section, but try to avoid looking there until you have tried it yourself. This way, you can help use it to validate your understanding.
