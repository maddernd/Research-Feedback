title: Put Together

For this chapter the main thing is to get back into the C# programming language and to be able to create a `Main` method within a class.

Here is a quick recap of the things you will need to recall:

- Start by creating a folder for your project
- Run `dotnet new console` to create the project file.
- You can add packages to your project using `dotnet add package <package name>`. For example, `dotnet add package splashkit`.
- Open your project's folder in VS Code when you want to edit it
- Create a `class` to contain your `Main` method.
- Add a `public static void Main()` which will be the entry point for your program.
- Build and run your program using `dotnet build` and `dotnet run` in the Terminal.
