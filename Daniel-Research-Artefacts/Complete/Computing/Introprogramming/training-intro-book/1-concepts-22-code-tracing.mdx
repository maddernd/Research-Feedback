title: Code Tracing
---

Understand the idea of tracing and how it can help you locate bugs in your programs.

Desk checking is a great way to more fully understand a piece of code, or to think through how an algorithm works, but it is only really effective when working on a single method. In many cases you need to locate a bug or issue that where you are not sure what causes the issue, or where it is located. For these situations you need other tools to help you find and fix the issue.

Code tracing is the process of placing additional code within your program to output progress. This can be useful for identifying exactly where a program crashes, and to check values of variables and expressions associated with the issue.

The simplest tracing statements just use `Console.WriteLine` to output messages as your program run. You can then include text to indicate which line you are up to, and values from expressions you want to check. Something as simple as `Console.WriteLine("Here...");` can tell you if the program reached a certain point or not.

While tracing is very simple, it can also be very effective. These simple statements can work in many situations where other techniques will not work.

## Your Task

Try instrumenting some of the programs you are working on. What do you think are some effective ways of pin pointing exactly where an error occurs using this technique?
