Our last step shows how to check for the spider catching the fly.

```csharp
using SplashKitSDK;
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

const string GAME_TIMER = "GameTimer";

const int SCREEN_WIDTH = 800;
const int SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600;
const int SPIDER_RADIUS = 25;
const int SPIDER_SPEED = 3;

const int FLY_RADIUS = 10;

// Set the spider in the center of the screen
int spiderX = SCREEN_WIDTH / 2;
int spiderY = SCREEN_HEIGHT / 2;

// Create the fly
int flyX = Rnd(SCREEN_WIDTH), flyY = Rnd(SCREEN_HEIGHT);
bool flyAppeared = false;
long appearAtTime = 1000 + Rnd(2000);
long escapeAtTime = 0;

OpenWindow("Flay Catch", SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT);

CreateTimer(GAME_TIMER);
StartTimer(GAME_TIMER);

// The event loop
while (!QuitRequested())
{
    // Handle Input
    if (KeyDown(KeyCode.RightKey) && spiderX + SPIDER_RADIUS < SCREEN_WIDTH)
    {
        spiderX += SPIDER_SPEED;
    }
    if (KeyDown(KeyCode.LeftKey) && spiderX - SPIDER_RADIUS > 0)
    {
        spiderX -= SPIDER_SPEED;
    }

    // Update the Game
    // Check if the fly should appear
    if (!flyAppeared && TimerTicks(GAME_TIMER) > appearAtTime)
    {
        // Make the fly appear
        flyAppeared = true;

        // Give it a new random position
        flyX = Rnd(SCREEN_WIDTH);
        flyY = Rnd(SCREEN_HEIGHT);
        
        // Set its escape time
        escapeAtTime = TimerTicks(GAME_TIMER) + 2000 + Rnd(5000);
    }
    else if (flyAppeared && TimerTicks(GAME_TIMER) > escapeAtTime)
    {
        flyAppeared = false;
        appearAtTime = TimerTicks(GAME_TIMER) + 1000 + Rnd(2000);
    }

    // Test if the spider and fly are touching
    if (CirclesIntersect(spiderX, spiderY, SPIDER_RADIUS, flyX, flyY, FLY_RADIUS))
    {
        flyAppeared = false;
        appearAtTime = TimerTicks(GAME_TIMER) + 1000 + Rnd(2000);
    }

    // Draw the game
    ClearScreen(ColorWhite());
    // Draw the spider
    FillCircle(ColorBlack(), spiderX, spiderY, SPIDER_RADIUS);

    if (flyAppeared)
    {
        // Draw the fly
        FillCircle(ColorDarkGreen(), flyX, flyY, FLY_RADIUS);
    }

    // Show it to  the user
    RefreshScreen(60);

    // Get any new user interactions
    ProcessEvents();
}
```

Wow, this is **a lot of code** to write directly within the program! Generally we would have brought in the code organisation features of the language to help make this easier for me, but we haven't covered those yet. The good thing is, once you master these concepts and can create code like this...it is all just going to get easier from here. 

In Part 2 we will see some tools we can use to help us better manage this code and make writing huge chunks of code like this a thing of the past. You will still use control flow, but you be able to divide the code up into clearer sections so you can more easily think through how each section works.
