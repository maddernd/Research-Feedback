## Example Class

Here is an example class that makes use of the syntax covered in this week.

```cs
public class MyRectangle
{
  // Fields to store the location of the MyRectangle object
  private int _x;
  private int _y;
  
  // Properties to access these fields.
  public int X
  {
    get { return _x; }
    set { _x = value; }
  }

  public int Y
  {
    get { return _y; }
    set { _y = value; }
  }

  // Examples of an auto-property. Where C# adds the code and fields for you.

  public int Width { get; set; }
  public int Height { get; set; }
  public Color DrawColor { get; set; }

  // A constructor that takes in data to position the My Rectangle object
  public MyRectangle(int x, int y)
  {
    _x = x; //set the field directly
    Y = y;  // or you can set it via the property.

    Width = 100; // Auto properties can only be accessed via the property
    Height = 50; // here we are using fixed values for the width and height.
    DrawColor = Color.Blue;
  }

  // Get the MyRectangle object to draw itself.
  public void Draw()
  {
    // Use SplashKit to draw, pass in the values read from the fields
    SplashKit.DrawRectangle(DrawColor, X, Y, Width, Height);
  }

  // Move the MyRectangle object
  // The x and y parameters say how much to move.
  public void MoveBy(int x, int y)
  {
    // Reads the old field value, add x to it, then store the new value back in the field.
    _x = _x + x; 
    // This does the same, but uses C# += ... which is the same as _y = _y + y;
    _y += y;
  }
}
```

Here is an example program that makes use of the above class.

```cs
public class Program
{
  public static void Main()
  {
    Window screen = new Window("Test Window", 400, 400);
    
    MyRectangle rect1 = new MyRectangle(10, 20);
    MyRectangle rect2 = new MyRectangle(120, 20);
    MyRectangle rect3 = new MyRectangle(240, 20) { Width = 50, Height = 20, DrawColor = Color.Green };

    rect2.DrawColor = Color.Red;
    rect2.Width = 20;
    rect2.Height = 300;

    screen.Clear(Color.White);
    rect1.Draw();
    rect2.Draw();
    rect3.Draw();
    screen.Refresh();
    SplashKit.Delay(5000);
  }
} 
```

## Class Declaration

<a id="FigureClassDeclaration"></a>
<img src={imgClassDeclaration.src} alt="This diagram shows the syntax for declaring a class with instance members." width="100%" />
<div class="caption">This diagram shows the syntax for declaring a class with instance members.</div><br/>

The following code snippet is of a `Shape` class with 2 private instance members, an `int x`, `int y`, as well as a `public void Draw()` method. This means that any objects of type Shape will have their own x and y integer variables, and a Draw method which they can invoke.

```cs
public class Shape
{
  private int _x;
  private int _y;

  public void Draw()
  {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Constructors

This diagram shows the syntax for declaring constructor:

<br/>
import imgConstructor from './images/sit771-constructors.png';

<a id="FigureConstructor"></a>
<img src={imgConstructor.src} alt="This diagram shows the syntax for declaring a constructor." width="100%" />
<div class="caption">This diagram shows the syntax for declaring a constructor.</div><br/>

## Fields

This diagram shows the syntax for fields:

<br/>
import imgFields from './images/sit771-fields.png';

<a id="FigureFields"></a>
<img src={imgFields.src} alt="This diagram shows the syntax for fields." width="100%" />
<div class="caption">This diagram shows the syntax for fields.</div><br/>


Just like instance methods are "attached" to each object of a given class, *fields* are variables associated with a given class (unless they're static). Each object has it's own memory allocation for each instance field.

Having a look at the code below, it has three fields, two of which are *instance fields*. (static fields are not instance fields).

```cs
public class Shape
{
  public static string Name = "Shawn";
  private int _x;
  private int _y;
}
```

Let's take a look at the public static string `name = "Shawn";`. 
- firstly, the `public` modifier, which means any code which has a reference to it can access and change it. 
- the `static` modifier means that the field's memory is shared across all `Shape` objects. 
- `string` is the type of the field. 
- Lastly, it is assigned the value "Shawn".

## Properties

Properties are "accessors" to an objects private fields. They can either just return the value of the field, or perform a calculation/expression.

properties are helpful because they act as accessors to fields. This means they provide ways for us to control how much access they have to a field.

This diagram shows the syntax for properties:

<br/>
import imgProperties from './images/sit771-properties.png';

<a id="FigureProperties"></a>
<img src={imgProperties.src} alt="This diagram shows the syntax for properties." width="100%" />
<div class="caption">This diagram shows the syntax for properties.</div><br/>

```cs
public class Shape()
{
  private int _x;
  public int X
  {
    get {return _x};
    set { _x = value };
  }
}
```

The `get` and `set` keywords tell us that this property has access to getting and setting the field.

A common pattern is to omit the `set`, which says that this field is `readonly`:

```cs
public class Shape()
{
  private int _x;
  public int X
  {
    get {return _x};
  }
}
```

We can also use **auto-implemented properties**, which are a helpful and quicker way to create a field and property. The following code will have a public `X` property, and a private field.

```cs
public class Shape()
{
  public int X { get; set; }
}
```

## Local Variables

Local variables are variables which are declared within a class's method. In the code example below we can see some local variables in the Main() method.

:::Note
Note that any code outside of Main() cannot access the variables - hence why they're called local!
:::

```cs
public class Shape
{
  private int x; //instance field
  private int y; //instance field

  public static void Main()
  {
    int i = 0; //local variable
    string name = "Fred"; //local variable
  }
}
```

This diagram shows the syntax for declaring variables in our code:


<br/>
import imgDeclaringVariables from './images/sit771-variable-declaration.png';

<a id="FigureDeclaringVariables"></a>
<img src={imgDeclaringVariables.src} alt="This diagram shows the syntax for declaring variables in our code." width="100%" />
<div class="caption">This diagram shows the syntax for declaring variables in our code.</div><br/>

## Return statement

Returning is an important part of our methods, it's how we signal that the method as finished doing its job, and if the method is a function, it let's us know which value to return to the caller.

This diagram shows the syntax for returning in our code:

<br/>
import imgReturnStatement from './images/sit771-return-statement.png';

<a id="FigureReturnStatement"></a>
<img src={imgReturnStatement.src} alt="This diagram shows the syntax for returning in our code." width="100%" />
<div class="caption">This diagram shows the syntax for returning in our code.</div><br/>

There are a few things to note when returning: * Void methods don't return a value, just use the `return1 statement: ie return;. 

- You must return a value who's type matches the return type of the method, ie: 
  - You can return any value of the correct type, so you can can return a variable (`return name;`), literal value (`return 3;`), or calculation (`return x + 50/2;`). The expression is evaluated, and then returned.

```cs
string GetName()
{
  return "John"; // "John" is a string, good :)
}

string GetName()
{
  return 3; // 3 is not a string, won't work :(
}
```

## Example program

We've covered a lot of new syntax this week, why don't you have a look at the following example program and try and identify all of the pieces of syntax we've spoken about?

```cs
using System;
using SplashKitSDK;

public class Program
{
  public static void Main()
  {
    Window w = new Window(...);
    StorageTank tnk = new StorageTank(100.0, 27.5, 10, 10, 70, 200);
  }
}

public class StorageTank
{
  private Color _liquidColor = Color.Blue;
  private readonly double _capacity;
  private double _level;

  private int _x, _y;
  private int _width, _height;

  public StorageTank(double capacity, double startLevel, int x, int y, int width, int height)
  {
    _x = x;
    _y = y;
    _width = width;
    _height = height;

    _capacity = capacity;
    _level = startLevel;
  }

  public Color LiquidColor
  {
    get { return _liquidColor; }
    set { _liquidColor = value; }
  }

  public double Capacity
  {
    get { return _capacity; }
  }

  public double Level
  {
    get { return _level; }
  }

  public double PercentFull
  {
    get { return _level / _capacity; }
  }

  public void AddLiquid(double amount)
  {
    _level = _level + amount;
  }

  public void TakeLiquid(double amount)
  {
    _level = _level - amount;
  }

  public void Draw(Window w)
  {
    double topY = y + height - height * PercentFull;
    w.FillRectangle(LiquidColor, x, topY, x + width, y + height);
    w.DrawRectangle(Color.Black, x, y, x + width, y + height);
  }
}
```

## Modifier Keywords Cheat Sheet

- **public:** Any class which references the object has access.
- **private:** Accessible only within the body of the class in which they are declared.
- **static:** Declares a member that belongs to the type itself instead of to a specific object.

There are other modifiers, which we'll take a look at in other weeks. See the [msdn reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6tcf2h8w.aspx) for further information.
