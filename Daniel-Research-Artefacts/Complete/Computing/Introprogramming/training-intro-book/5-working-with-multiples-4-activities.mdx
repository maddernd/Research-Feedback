## Test Your Knowledge

### Store POS -- Adding more Products

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="sXJ64lNd3zc" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autoplay=1"/>
</div>

Now that we have access to arrays, we can add some more products to our application without repeating ourselves!

For this iteration, your program should:

- Allow the user to store the details of up to 10 products, not just one.
- Have an "Add Product" screen which allows users to add a new product to the system.
- Have a "View Products" screen which prints a list of the entered products to the terminal.
- Allow the user to select a product from the "View Products" screen and edit the details of that product, or delete the product from the list.

### Dotifin -- Adding More Songs

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="-WPFjUR4h0w" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autoplay=1"/>
</div>

Now that we have access to arrays, we should be able to work with more than one song in Dotifin.

For this iteration, your program should:

- Allow the user to load up to 10 songs, not just one.
- Have an "Add Song" screen which allows users to add and load a new song to Dotifin.
- Have a "View Songs" screen which prints a list of the loaded songs to the terminal.
- Allow the user to select a song from the "View Songs" screen, and play the song, edit the details of that song, or delete it from the list.

### RPG -- Adding Multiple NPCs

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="8tGw0C0njoM" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autoplay=1"/>
</div>

Now we have access to arrays, we can bring our game to life by adding multiple NPCs.

For this iteration, your program should:

- Have a frames per second of 60 (hint: you can pass `refresh_screen` an argument specifying the number of frames per second you want).
- Allow the game to have up to 100 NPCs at any one time.
- Start with 20 NPCs.
- Have a `create_random_npc` function which creates a new NPC at a random location on the screen and returns it.
- Have an `add_npc` procedure which adds a new random NPC to the game.
- Add a new randomly positioned NPC to the game whenever two NPCs are within a relatively small distance of each other.
- Include a "time to live" value in `NPC`. This value:
  - starts at 60
  - gets reduced by one each game loop
  - gets reset to 60 whenever the player character is close
- Check every game loop whether any NPCs have died (i.e., the NPC's "time to live" is equal to or less than 0). If so, the dead NPC farthest away from the player character should be removed from the game.
- End and indicate that the player has lost the game if all of the NPCs die.
- End and indicate that the player has won the game if the game contains three times the initial number of NPCs.
