The first example uses syntax which supports multiple lambda arguments 

```cs
Comparison compare; 
compare = (StockItem item1, StockItem item2) => item1.Name.CompareTo ( item2.Name );
```

The second example is a single lambda argument expression, in which no braces are needed () 

```cs
cs var doubleIt = x => x * 2;
```

- The var keyword is used to tell the compiler to determine the type of the variable. This is useful for us in the above example because it means any type of number will be doubled and stored.
