Programming languages offer a number of functions and procedures that are used to interact with files. These will allow you to save data to a file, and load data back from the file.

import imgIOfileIO from './images/io-file-io.png';

<a id="FigureIOfileIO"></a>
<img src={imgIOfileIO.src} alt="File operations include the ability to open, read, write, and close files" width="100%" />
<div class="caption">File operations include the ability to open, read, write, and close files</div><br/>

:::note
- Programming languages will provide functions and procedures to: 
  - **Open** a file so you can interact with its contents.
  - **Read** data from a file that has been opened to be read.
  - **Write** data to a file that has been opened to be written to.
  - **Close** a file that is currently open.
- Languages will also provide built in file types that are used with these functions and procedures.
- When you open a file you indicate if you want read and/or write access to its contents.
- Opening a file gives you access to a cursor that you can use to read data from the file, or write data to the file.
- Standard usage will be to open the file, read/write data to the file, and then close the file.
