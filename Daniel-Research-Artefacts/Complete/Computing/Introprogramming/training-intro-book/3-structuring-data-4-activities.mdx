### Store POS -- Creating Products

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="V76uK_JyoEg" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autoplay=1"/>
</div>

Now that we've got the backbone of the store POS, we can add some more functionality. Here we're going to be creating and incorporating the concept of "Stock" into the program.

For this iteration, your program should:

- Have a `Product` struct with a:
  - name
  - brand
  - category (one of: Dairy, Bakery, Snack, Frozen)
  - current stock level
- Have a `StorePOS` struct with:
  - a `Product`
  - a sale count
- Be updated from the [previous iteration](../2-organising-code/4-activities#store-pos--input-system) to make use of a single `StorePOS` and `Product`.
- Have an "Add Product" screen which allows the user to enter a new product's details (hint: for now, this new product will override the previous product in `StorePOS`).
- Have a "Print Product" screen which prints the details of the last added product to the terminal.

Validation:

- Ensure that the user's selection of screen matches one of the options.
- Ensure that the user inputs a valid amount of product stock — it should not be negative or unreasonably high.
- Ensure that the user selects a valid product category.

### Dotifin -- Creating Songs and Artists

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="3VjUeRelMTU" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autoplay=1"/>
</div>

Now that we've got the backbone of Dotifin, we can add some song information to make the program feel more like a proper music application.

For this iteration, your program should:

- Have a `Song` struct with a:
  - file name
  - name
  - genre (one of Pop, Rock, RnB)
  - number of listens
- Have a `Dotifin` struct with:
  - a `Song`
  - a number of total listens
- Be updated from the [previous iteration](../2-organising-code/4-activities#dotifin--input-system) to make use of a single `Dotifin` and `Song`.
- Have a "Load Music" screen which allows the user to enter the details of a song (hint: for now, this song will override the previous song in `Dotifin`)
- Have a "Play Music" screen which plays the currently loaded song.
- Have a "Stop Music" screen which stops playback of the currently playing song.
- Have a "Print Song" screen which prints the currently loaded song's details to the terminal.

Validation:

- Ensure that the user's selection of screen matches one of the options.
- Ensure that the user inputs a valid number of listens for a song — it should not be negative or unreasonably high.
- Ensure that the user selects a valid song genre.
- Ensure that the file path entered by the user represents a valid song.

### RPG -- Player and NPC Attributes

<div class="not-content">
  <YouTube id="-wrcqskoYlk" params="fs=1&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autoplay=1"/>
</div>

Now that we have a basic game loop and player movement, let's give the player character and NPC some attributes which we can use to make our life easier.

For this iteration, your program should:

- Have a `Player` struct with:
  - a position (x and y)
  - a movement speed
  - a colour
- Have an NPC struct with:
  - a position (x and y)
  - an "is player close" status
  - a "normal" colour
  - a "close" colour
- Have a `Game` struct with:
  - a `Player`
  - a `NPC`
  - a game state (one of: Running, Won, Lost)
- Be updated from the [previous iteration](../../2-organising-code/4-activities#rpg--game-loop-and-collision-tests) to make use of a single `Player`, `NPC`, and `Game`.
- Draw the NPC at all times (even if the player character is colliding with it), but change the NPC's colour from "normal" to "close" if the player character is close.
