title: Putting it together
---

Object oriented programming is about creating objects that know and can do things. Use the concepts covered to start building larger programs.

We have already covered a great deal, so the focus of this week is on consolidating what has already been covered. Review the concepts learnt and put them into practice by building larger programs.

What are you looking forward to learning this week? Let us know in the comments.
