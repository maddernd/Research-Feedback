The flowcharts and pseudocode shown communicate the logic that needs to be coded into the functions and procedures of this program. You can use these design plans with the language syntax to implement this.

For this program, main can populate the array with values and then output the different statistics. We can then extend this in the next step with a few nice additions, but for now, let's get the main functionality working.

## Iteration Plan

Remember to implement the solution a little at a time, compiling and running it frequently as you progress. Try implementing the solution using the following smaller steps, and the tests shown for each.

1. Start by getting `Read Double` to work. In `Main` just read a single value and output it to the Terminal. **Tests**:
    - You should be able to get the code for this from your earlier projects.
    - Check that a number can be read correctly.
    - Try entering text, and check the error message is shown and that you can enter a number the next time.
    - Enter multiple text values on a single line.
    - Also try multiple text values, one after the other.
2. Implement `Populate Array`. Include an array in `Main`, and have its values read in by `Populate Array`. Print the values back to the Terminal so that you can check this code is working. **Tests**:
    - Enter each of the values and check they are printed out correctly.
    - Try entering text, this should be handled by `Read Double` but check it is working correctly with `Populate Array`.
3. Implement the `Sum` Function. **Tests**:
    - Test that it works with some basic values.
    - Try all negative values.
    - Try a mix of positive and negative values.
4. Implement the `Mean` Function. Same tests as `Sum`.
5. Finish by implementing the `Maximum` Function. Same tests as `Sum`.

By building the code a little at a time, and running tests as you go, you will have less code to search when you do have an issue. This makes it easier to fix those little errors that are likely to slip into the code from time to time.

When this iterative process is complete you should have a solution for the statistics calculator. You should be able to easily change this so that it can read in ten, a hundred, or even a thousand values from the user. This is something that would not have been possible without using arrays.

:::note

- Get your code running as soon as you can
- Build a little and test a little as you go
- When you find a bug, start looking for it in the code you just added (or changed)
- You can perform this as a **design, implement, compile, test** cycle. This enables you to build the program a small piece at a time. Before you start this it is likely to be a good idea to have at least sketched out a plan for the design
- As you develop your design skills, you will be able to create larger designs before you code. Whiloe you are learning to program, it is ok to design and code at the same time as this lets you quickly test if your design will work
