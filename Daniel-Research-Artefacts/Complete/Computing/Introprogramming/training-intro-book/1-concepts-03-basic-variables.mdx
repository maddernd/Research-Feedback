Explore using variables in your code in order to remember things! See how we can declare and assign values to variables.

Variables are extremely useful in programming, they are how we remember stuff!

In this video, we are going to see how to create a few of our own variables such as an: `int age`, `double weight`, and `string name`.
We'll take a quick look at identifiers and types, as well as how to `assign` values to these variables using *literal* values and *expressions*!
