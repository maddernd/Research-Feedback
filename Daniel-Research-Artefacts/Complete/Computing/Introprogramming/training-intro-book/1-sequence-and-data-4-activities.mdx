Having explored this leg of the journey you are now approaching a rest stop and a chance to practice and reflect.

## Test Your Knowledge

The following activities describe a program that you can create using the concepts we have learned so far. Use these to validate that you have developed the knowledge and skills needed to create programs that involve sequence and data.

As you work through the activities, focus on the **programming process and tools**.
Build your program in several iterations of: understand what you need, design the logic, implement the code, and test that it works.
Focus on **syntax** for the different instructions, and pick up some methods you can use in the libraries we are using.
Notice which **programming concepts** you are using, and think about how it relates to the building blocks and terminology we introduced through this chapter. In particular, focus on the idea of sequence, the use of building blocks such as variables, constants, data types, and method calls, and the terminology for expressions and literal values.

### Unit Converter

</div>

Here we will be putting together everything we learned across this chapter into something that might help us -- a unit converter!

In this task, it is up to you to create a program that takes in a number of millimeters and converts them into the metric units for centimeters, meters, and kilometers, as well as imperial units for inches, feet, and miles.

For your reference, there are:

- 10 millimeters in a centimeter.
- 100 centimeters in a meter.
- 1000 meters in a kilometer.
- 25.4 millimeters in an inch.
- 12 inches in a foot.
- 5280 feet in a mile.

Your program should:

- Ask the user how many millimeters they would like to convert.
- Print out the resultant conversions for both metric and imperial units.

### Sound Player

Here we will be trying out some SplashKit functionality and playing a song (or part thereof) back to us!

In this task, it is up to you to create a program which plays part of an audio file for us.
You might find it helpful to revisit the page on [playing music in SplashKit](/book/part-1-instructions/1-sequence-and-data/1-concepts/11-3-audio) for this task.

Your program should:

- Ask the user for the path to a song file.
- Ask the user for a name for the song.
- Ask the user how long they would like the song to play for (in seconds).
- Play the song for specified amount of time at 50% volume.
- Play the song for specified amount of time at 100% volume.

### Game Splash Screen

</div>

Here we will be creating the beginning of any good game: a splash-screen/title animation!

In this task, it is up to you to create a short sequence of SplashKit method calls (drawing shapes, colours, images, and delays) to act as an introduction or title animation to a game.
You might find it helpful to revisit the page on [drawing in SplashKit](../1-concepts/11-2-graphics/#drawing-to-a-window) for this task.

Your program should:

- Welcome the user to the game with an appropriate title.
- Play an introductory animation using shapes, colors, and delays.
