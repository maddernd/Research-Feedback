title: Overview
---

In [Part 2, Chapter 2](../../../part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/0-overview) we learned how to organise the instructions in our code into named groups called **functions** and **procedures**.
Then, in [Part 2, Chapter 3](../../../part-2-organised-code/3-structuring-data/0-overview) we learned how we can use **custom data types** to organise the data in our programs.
These two ideas were combined in [Part 2, Chapter 7](../../../part-2-organised-code/7-member-functions/0-overview) where we explored adding member functions to our structs.

Classes combine functions, procedures, and data into a single entity in the same way as we saw in Part 2. 
They are a powerful tool, and open up new and exciting capabilities for building digital realities.

In this chapter we will explore the power of **classes**, to move beyond organising our code, and to start modelling our concepts within our programs.

## Learning goals

By the end of this chapter you should be able to:

* Describe what a class is, and how classes relate to objects.
* Read UML class diagrams and implement the class structures they describe.
* Write basic UML class diagrams to communicate your own class structures.
* Explain and visualise what the computer does during the runtime of simple programs using classes.
