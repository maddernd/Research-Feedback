title: C/C++ Naming Conventions
---

C# has a consistent set of naming conventions, but with C/C++ there are many ways that things are coded. With SplashKit and the code in this guide, we will use the following conventions for the identifiers we create and use:

- snake_case for functions and procedures (the equivalent of C# methods).
- snake_case for variables.
- UPPER_CASE for constants.

For example, what was `WriteLine` in C# will be `write_line` in C/C++. Similarly, the `appearAtTime` variable in C# would be `appear_at_time` in C/C++. Constants like `WINDOW_WIDTH` would be the same in C# and C/C++.

:::tip
Consistency with things like coding conventions is important to help make it easier for others to engage with your code. As you shift between languages, one of the things you should pay attention to is the way identifiers are written. Using the right coding convention will help make your code look right to the community of developers who know and use that language.
