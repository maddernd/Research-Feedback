  label: " - Current Flow"

We can use a flowchart to help us capture the sequence that currently exists within the change calculator. This can be captured at a high level, allowing us to see how the main steps of the program are sequenced.
Note the use of a box with a dotted outline to capture and label related group of instructions -- this is often a helpful addition to the readability of a flow chart.

:::note

- At the moment, the **Give Change** step is the sequence that involves calculating and providing change for each coin type.
- There are no decisions in this flow, the program is just the sequence of actions.
