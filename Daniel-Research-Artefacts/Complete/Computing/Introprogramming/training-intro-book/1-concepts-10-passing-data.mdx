title: Passing data to methods
---

Sometimes methods need to know data that is not part of what the object knows, but  is also not something the method can work out itself. In these cases, you can pass data to the method using parameters. This allows the caller to supply the value. 

When you clear a window the Clear method needs to know the colour you want to use. It cannot  work it out for itself and it is not something the Window wants to remember. When you tell the Window to clear you also tell it the colour to use. 

- Parameters allow values to be passed into a method
- When you call the method you must pass in the right number of values: one for each parameter. 

## Your Task

Explore the methods on the Window class in SplashKit. What kinds of things are passed to the methods? Is there only one way of calling each method?
