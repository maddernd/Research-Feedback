Your goal in this stage is to understand what you are aiming to build with sufficient detail to be able to think through the steps a computer would need to undertake to achieve a desired result.

You have most likely purchased something in cash and calculated the change you should receive at some point in your life. For example, if you were receiving $6.50 in coins you probably just know that ideally it should be given to you as three $2 coins and one 50c coin. While the task of calculating change is relatively simple, it does not mean that you can skip thinking about it. What you need to now is think through the steps that you perform intuitively.

## Thinking about inputs and outputs

One good first step in understanding what a program needs to do is to think through the inputs and outputs.
For our change calculator these will be:

* **Input:** the cost of the item purchased and the amount paid. Entered by the user at the terminal.
* **Output:** the number of each type of coin to give as change.

We could imagine that running the completed program should look something like this:

```bash title="Terminal output example (not code)"
$ dotnet run
Cost of item (in cents): 15
Amount paid (in cents): 500
Change: 2 x $2, 0 x $1, 1 x 50c, 1 x 20c, 1 x 10c, 1 x 5c

$ dotnet run
Cost of item (in cents): 150
Amount paid (in cents): 250
Change: 0 x $2, 1 x $1, 0 x 50c, 0 x 20c, 0 x 10c, 0 x 5c

$ dotnet run
Cost of item (in cents): 175 
Amount paid (in cents): 200
Change: 0 x $2, 0 x $1, 0 x 50c, 1 x 20c, 0 x 10c, 1 x 5c
```

This is a good start, as we now have a clear understanding of our initial data, and the end goal of our program.
However, we still need to think through how we get from one to the other.
