Most of the time it is best to try to avoid having to deal with dynamic memory allocations. Rather than using this throughout your project you can focus on it within dedicated utilities. Then you can use these where needed within your projects.

In this section we will look at building a [dynamic array](../02-0-dynamic-array) and a [linked list](../03-0-linked-list). The focus within each of these utilities will be to manage the dynamic memory allocations for us. We can then look at how we can use these within our programs.
