Up to this point our focus has been on sequence, data, and control flow. These mechanics exist in every imperative program, but we had reached a point where we were limited in what we could do.

In this chapter we have seen how these concepts apply in a new programming language.
This has set the foundation for us to work at a lower level, and explore new tools and approaches that allow us to organise our code.
By dividing our code into smaller chunks we will be able to simplify our existing programs and start to build larger and more complex software.
