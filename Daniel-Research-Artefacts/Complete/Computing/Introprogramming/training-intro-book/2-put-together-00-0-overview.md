In this chapter we have seen how to organise our code into functions and procedures. This should help us to reduce the complexity of having to deal with large volumes of logic at one time. Using functions and procedures we can now divide up the logic into meaningful chunks, and deal with these one at a time.

In this section we will see how to put together all the concepts we have learnt so far. We will start by looking at the changes we can make to the change calculator, where we can break the logic into smaller functions and procedures. Following this, we will look a new program for a "guess that number" game. This will let us see how to design a program using functions and procedures from the ground up, while also recapping the details on sequence and data and control flow. Finally, we will look at the fly catch game.
