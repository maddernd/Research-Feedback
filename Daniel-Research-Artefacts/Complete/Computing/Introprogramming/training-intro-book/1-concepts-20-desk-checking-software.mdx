title: Desk Checking Software
---

Desk checking refers to the process of stepping through your program yourself to see what happens, or to work out what the computer is doing. The process is relatively simple, you put yourself in the position of the computer and run through the sections of code that you are interested in understanding better. Like the computer would, you should start with the first instruction and proceed from there in **sequence**. Run each instruction in turn, and walk yourself through the project just like the computer will.

The purpose of desk checking software is really to explore code, to better understand what it does or how it works. It can also be used to work out why things are not working as intended. As you work your way through the code it usually becomes apparent why things are not working, and hopefully the process will also highlight what can be done to make things work as you want.

## Keeping Track of Values

To help with this process you need to have a piece of paper and a pencil alongside your code. When a **variable** is created, draw a box on your piece of paper to represent this variable. Write the name of the variable next to the box so you know which variable it is. This is similar to the process the computer performs, reserving space for the value and associating it with the variable's identifier.

When you encounter an **assignment statement**, you can evaluate the value and then write it in the box with the matching variable name. Cross out any old value, as the variable only has a single value. When you encounter a variable in an **expression**, you can then read the current value from within the box and use that.

The only other thing you need to know if the actions that each statement performs. So review what each statement does and make sure you can follow those steps when you run through the program yourself.

Remember that computers are unintelligent, so you don't need to apply any intelligence to run through the code like this. In fact, being intelligent will be a hindrance as you may be tempted to do what you think it should do, not what it does do. So try to focus on just doing what the computer would do.

## Your Task

What kinds of code do you think developers mostly desk check, and why?
