:::note
Your goal now is to feel good! Getting a program to run should always be a moment to be proud of your achievements.

Hopefully this has helped you see how you can put the concepts from this chapter to work. The main thing is to think about is what you want to achieve, and working out the small steps that you will need the computer to perform. Once you have this basic outline of the process in mind, you can identify the variables and constants you will need so that you need to have all the information somewhere in the code for you to use. With this more complete plan, you can use the syntax of the programming language to help you convert your ideas into code.
Remember at every stage of the process that the computer is unintelligent, and will do exactly and only what you tell it to do.

:::tip
The computer is an intelligent machine. If you think about what you have achieved it is quite remarkable. Your program controls current flowing through millions of transistors, getting them to flick back and forth millions of times per second, so that current flow to parts of the display and responding to switches/buttons being presses by the user. Yet we never really thought about any of that! This all achieved through abstraction - which means we can think about our code as sequences of instructions that work with data.

If you get stuck, the [wrap up](../../5-wrap-up/1-change) section includes a working version of this program's code. Make sure you have a go at coding the change calculator yourself, and avoid using tools like GitHub Copilot for the moment. These tools can help generate code for you, but you want to know how to do this yourself first. Similarly, copying the code that is provided won't help you understand how to write it yourself. Even just the practice of typing it in will help you think through each of the steps.

Next let's have a look at a couple of extra example programs. These will help you see and practice the programming process.
