title: Viewing BOM Data
---

Revisit the BOM temperature data program to see how we could use arrays to easily visualise the temperature data.

Now that we can read in the CSV data downloaded from the BOM, let's extend the program to graphically visualise this data. We can then add some code to allow the user to visually explore the data on the screen.

[Download](/resources/code-examples/part-2/5-working-with-multiples/bom-data/ViewingBOMData.zip) the code and resources used in this video.
