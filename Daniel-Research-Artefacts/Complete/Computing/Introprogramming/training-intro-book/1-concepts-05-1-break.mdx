The break statement is used to jump **out** of the current loop. As shown in the visualisation below, this is useful for ending a loop early.

![The Break Statement allows you to end a loop early](./images/statement-break.png "The Break Statement allows you to end a loop early")
{/* TODO: add paper dot background to image */}

## Break -- when, why, and how?

Sometimes you get part-way through a loop and know that the remainder of the loop's code is not needed, and there is no need to check the loop's condition again. If you can capture that in a condition, then combining a [branching statement](../03-0-branching) with a `break` will let you jump out of the loop.

This isn't something you will use often, but is good to know exists.

## In C#

:::tip[Syntax]
The C# syntax for a break statement is shown in the following diagram.

![C# syntax for a break statement](./images/break-statement.png)
:::

The break statement is simply the `break` keyword terminated with a semicolon.

## How break works

### Ending a loop early

The following code demonstrates the use of the break statement in an event driven program. Here the `if` statement checks whether the user has hit the escape key on their keyboard, and it breaks the event loop when that is true.

```csharp
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

OpenWindow("Circle Test", 400, 400);
ClearScreen(ColorWhite());

while (!QuitRequested())
{
    FillCircle(RandomColor(), Rnd(ScreenWidth()), Rnd(ScreenHeight()), Rnd(50));
    RefreshScreen();

    ProcessEvents();

    if (KeyTyped(KeyCode.EscapeKey))
    {
        break;  // end the loop
    }
}
```

The following images show how this works.

### Leaving intentionally infinite loops

You can create intentionally infinite loops, and use `break` statements within the code to terminate the loop. The following program uses an infinite loop, with a break in an `if` statement to terminate the loop.

```csharp
using static System.Console;
using static System.Convert;

WriteLine("Before you stands a 12 foot tall Knight...");
WriteLine();
WriteLine("\"We are the Knights who say 'Ni'.\"");
WriteLine("\"I will say Ni to you again if you do not appease us!\"");

while(true)
{
    WriteLine("\"Ni!\"");

    Write("Submit? ");
    
    if (ReadLine() == "y")
    {
        break;
    }

}

WriteLine("\"Bring us a Shrubbery!\"");
```

:::caution[Use your power wisely]
Just because you *can* do something in code doesn't mean it's a *good* way of doing it.
Try to avoid writing intentionally infinite loops.
In some cases doing so can make your code simpler, but usually there's a way of restructuring your logic to use a condition instead.

This example was inspired by the classic Monty Python sketch below. This comedy group was the inspiration behind the name for the Python programming language.

</div>

:::note[Summary]

- The break statement is an **instruction** allowing you to jump to the end of the current loop.
- The break statement is typically coded within a [branching](../03-0-branching) statement that checks if the loop should terminate early.
