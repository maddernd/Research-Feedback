title: Overview

So far we have explored sequence, data, control flow, and how to organise our code. In this chapter we can now see how to structure data in more meaningful way within our code. We will start by look at the fly catch game, adding structs and enums will really help us in modelling this game. Following this, we will go back to the change calculator, seeing how we can use structs and enums in this program. The change calculator does not have as much going on as the fly game, so structs and enums will not have as much impact, but we can use this to start thinking about expanding this program.
