There are two main file formats that you can work with in your program: binary files and text files. A text file stores its data as textual characters, whereas a binary file stores the values directly in the file.

<div class="caption">Files can store <em>textual</em> or <em>binary</em> data</div><br/>

:::note

- [Figure x.y](#FigureIOfileFormats) shows a binary and text file used to save the text 'Hello' and the integer 127.
- In the text file they are stored as the characters 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', and '1', '2', and '7' separated by a space. 
- In the *binary* file the characters are stored in the same way (as they are text), but the integer is stored as the value 127 which if interpreted as text is a *delete* character.
- If you opened these files in a text editor you could read the values from the text file, but you would see a strange character instead of the number 127 in the binary file
