title: C File Type

C includes a `FILE` type that is used to interact with files on the computer. This type includes all of the information that C needs to read and write data to a file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    char message[12] = "Hello World";
    char in_message[6] = "";
    int val = 127;
    int in_val = 0;

    FILE *out;
    FILE *in;

    out = fopen("test.txt", "w");
    if(out == NULL) return -1;
    fprintf(out, "%s\n%d", message, val); // Write the message, and a new line
    fclose(out);

    in = fopen("test.txt", "r");
    if(in == NULL) return -1;

    fscanf(in, "%5[^\n]", in_message); // read first 5 characters of the message
    fscanf(in, "%*[^\n]", in_message); // skip anything else on the line
    fscanf(in, "%*[\n]", in_message); // skip the new line
    fscanf(in, "%d", &in_val); // read the number

    fclose(in);

    printf("Read: %s & %d\n", in_message, in_val);

    return 0;

}

:::note

- The `FILE` type is used to read and write data from a file.
- You open the file using `fopen`.
- After the file has been opened you must remember to close it using `fclose`.
- File based versions of `printf` and `scanf` allow you to read and write data from the file.
- The IO code in C always works with `FILE` pointers, as a result all of your `FILE` variables will be pointers.
