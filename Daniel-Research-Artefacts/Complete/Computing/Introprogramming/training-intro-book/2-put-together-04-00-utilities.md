title: Shared Utilities
---

To wrap up this section, let's consider how we can share some of our code across different projects. In the [forward declaration](/book/part-2-organised-code/2-organising-code/1-concepts/07-forward-declarations) section we looked at how to share functions and procedures by using header files. So let's create our own *utilities.h* header inside which we can put functions and procedures we want to share.

## What can we share with other projects?

If we look back over the code we have created so far, we often have functions to read data from the user. This includes `read_string` and `read_integer`, and we could extend of this as we go.

To build this we first need to create two files:

- **utilities.h** - this will contain the function signatures. These are the promises that these functions will exist and can be used.
- **utilities.cpp** - this will contain the implementation of the functions.

This will mean that we have to compile both the *utilities.cpp* and the project code file. The following shows the command to run at the terminal to compile *program.cpp* and *utilities.cpp* into a single program called *test*. The important thing is that you are passing both files to the compiler, otherwise you will get a linker error when it tries to find anything implemented in the missing file.

```zsh
clang++ program.cpp utilities.cpp -l SplashKit -o test
```

## Creating the header file

The header file will include header guards and the signatures for your functions. You can copy these from an existing project where you have declared these functions. Remember the signature is just the first line of the function declaration, terminated with a `;` where the block of instructions would go.

```cpp
#ifndef UTILITIES_H
#define UTILITIES_H

#include <string>
using std::string;

/**
 * Read a string from the user
 *
 * @param prompt the message to show the user
 * @returns the string entered
 */
string read_string(string prompt);

/**
 * Read an integer from the user
 *
 * @param prompt the message to show the user
 * @returns the integer entered
 */
int read_integer(string prompt);

#endif
```

This header says that there are two functions available: `read_string` and `read_integer`. We have included the string header and added `using std::string;` as we want to make use of the string type (which is not available without this).

Including the documentation in the header is a great idea, as this can then be read by the editors like VS Code and help describe the function as you go to use it.

## Implementing the utilities

The code in the *utilities.cpp* will have just the code to implement these functions, but can include additional headers to access functions you need to implement these.

```cpp
#include "utilities.h"
#include "splashkit.h"

string read_string(string prompt)
{
  write(prompt);
  return read_line();
}

int read_integer(string prompt)
{
  string line = read_string(prompt);
  while (!is_integer(line))
  {
    write_line("Please enter a whole number.");
    line = read_string(prompt);
  }
  return stoi(line);
}
```

## Using the utilities

Once you have this setup, you can now use these functions by including your header and compiling the *utilities.cpp* along with your other program code.

```cpp
#include "utilities.h"
#include "splashkit.h"

using std::to_string;

int main()
{
  string name;
  name = read_string("Please enter your name: ");

  int age;
  age = read_integer("Please enter your age: ");

  write_line("Hello " + name + " " + to_string(age));
}
```

You can then compile and run this from the command line using:

```zsh
clang++ program.cpp utilities.cpp -l SplashKit -o test
./test
```

## Adjusting VS Code settings

To build and run this in VS Code, and to use the debugger, we will need to adjust the **tasks.json** to also compile the `utilities.cpp` file along with the currently selected file. You can do this by adding a line to the `args` settings as shown below. This list contains the arguments that are passed to the `clang++` program when it is called, so including `"utilities.cpp",` will add that file when the compiler is called.

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "cppbuild",
      "label": "C/C++: clang++ build active file",
      "command": "/usr/bin/clang++",
      "args": [
        "-fcolor-diagnostics",
        "-fansi-escape-codes",
        "-g",
        "${file}",
        "utilities.cpp",
        "-o",
        "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",
        "-l",
        "SplashKit"
      ],
      "options": {
        "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
      },
      "problemMatcher": [
        "$gcc"
      ],
      "group": "build",
      "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
    }
  ],
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

You should be able to check the output tab when you build and run, and it will show you what VS Code called when it compiled your program.
