title: Final Change Calculator
---

Our version of the final change calculator code is shown below. Remember there are several ways that you can get this working. If you got this working yourself you are well on the way to seeing how this all comes together.

Remember to use this to help you build your own solution.

```csharp
/*
* Program: Simple Change
* Calculate the ideal change for a given transaction.

:::note
See how the indentation helps you see the structure of the program. The cases are indented within the switch, the switch within the for, which is within the if in the do while.

Indentation is really important to help you see and work with your code.
