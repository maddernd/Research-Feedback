title: Implementing Inheritance
---

In C#, inheritance is part of the class declaration. At the top of the class, after its name, you can place a colon (`:`) and then the name of the _parent class_. The following code snippet shows the declaration of the `Rectangle` and `Ellipse` classes. It shows that these classes both inherit from the `Shape` class.

```cs
  public class Shape
  {
    public Color Color {get; set;}
    public int X {get; set;}
    public int Y { get; set; }
    public int Width { get; set; }
    public int Height { get; set; }

    public void Draw()
    {
        SplashKit.FillRectangle(Color, X, Y, Width, Height);
    }

  }

  public class Rectangle : Shape
  {
  }

  public class Ellipse : Shape
  {
  }

  public class Program
  {
      public static void Main()
      {
          Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
          r.Color = Color.Red;
          r.X = 100;
          r.Y = 50;
          r.Width = 75;
          r.Height = 25;

          Ellipse e = new Ellipse();
          e.Color = Color.Green;
          e.X = 15;
          e.Y = 200;
          e.Width = 50;
          e.Height = 50;
      }
  }
```

Notice that `Main` is able to create rectangle and ellipse shapes, and interact with the properties they have inherited from the `Shape` class. If you think about inheritance as "**is a kind of**", then this makes sense. A `Rectangle` is a kind of `Shape`. So rectangle objects will have these properties, as each rectangle object is a kind of shape.

## Scope Modifiers

With inheritance it is now sometimes necessary to be able to share access to a class's members to child classes, while keeping this protected from others. To achieve this there is an additional scope modifier, `protected`, which allows you to share members with only those classes that inherit from this class.

Modifier | The Class | Child Classes | Other Classes
---------|----------|--------- |---------
 `public` | Can access | Can access | Can access
 `protected` | Can access | Can access | No access
 `private` | Can access | No access | No access

The `protected` modifier is useful in cases where you want to give child classes access to a field or method that should not otherwise be available.
