title: Building Objects

Review concepts covered and how they come together to create meaningful programs.

Object oriented programming involves designing software build from a number of interacting objects. The program's goals are achieved by objects interacting, with each object playing its own role.

In C#, classes are used to define the roles that objects will play. Allowing you to define what objects created from this class will know and be able to do.

Within the class you declare **fields** to store things that the object will _know_. Each field is a variable that stores a single value, and exists within the object when it is created.

Classes can also contain **methods** which describe what objects of this class can do. Each method contains a list of instructions which are executed by the object when the method is called.

**Methods** may also contain variables, as with local variables or parameter. Parameters allow the method to accept data from the caller, allowing it to use information given to it to get the object to perform this task. Local variables allow methods to store values that are only needed within the method: short term memory.

By default, the instructions within each method are run in **sequence**, but this can be extended with control flow statements. Control flow allows you to move beyond sequence, with the addition of **selection** and **repetition** statements.

In C#, selection (or branching) statements include the **if** and **switch** statements. _If_ allows you to say some code should only run _if_ a condition is true, while the **switch** statement uses an expression to jump to a matching **case**.

Repetition statements (or loops) include **while** and **do while** loops: while as a pre-test loop and do while as a post-test loop.

These are the main control flow statements and artefacts that go into every program you have used. There is not much more. These tools are what programs are built from.

# Your Task

Reflect on the programs you use, and think about how they may be constructed. Can you identify some points that will be using the different control flow structures, or the kinds of objects they may be using.
