title: Making a Comparer Lambda
---

See how delegates and lambda expressions can be used to provide flexible sort options.

Interface inheritance allows you to interact with objects over a defined protocol, such as with the `IComparable` interface in order to enable the list to sort its contents. This interface has only a single method, and so another possibility is to use a method directly. Explore how we can use the C# delegate type in order to provide a `Comparer` that can be used to compare two objects, giving the List the method it needs to sort its contents in different ways.
