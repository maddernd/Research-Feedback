Over the previous chapter you have learnt to create programs that manipulate data. So far this data has only existed within the program, with the values stored being lost when the program terminates. If you want to be able to maintain these values between executions you need to learn to save data to file. By saving the programâ€™s data to file you can then load it back in when the program is restarted.

This chapter will introduce the artefacts needed to save data from your program to file, and to load that data from file. Using this you will be able to persist data, making it available to future executions of the program.
When you have understood the material in this chapter you will be able to save and load data from text and binary files.
