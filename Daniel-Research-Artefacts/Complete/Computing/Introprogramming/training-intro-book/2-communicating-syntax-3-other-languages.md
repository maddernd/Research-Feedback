There are a number of ways that grammars can be expressed. Generally these are expressed textually, and not directly used to help teach the language. This is a shame as the grammar is the most direct way to learn when you want to pick up new language.

For now it is probably best not to explore too much into language grammars, as these are generally written for compiler developers rather than compiler users. Once you feel on top of your first language, it is good to try to pick up another. This will really help you see how similar things are, particularly if you try to implement some of the same programs.
