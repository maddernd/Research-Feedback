title: Making the Switch
---


Examine object collaboration by adding a List Switch to the Light Simulator.

Getting objects working together requires us to use fields that will allow the object to access and work with another object. In this video we will extend the Light Simulator to add a Light Switch which can control a Light Bulb. Clicking the switch will toggle the power to the light, turning it on and off.
