title: Let's remember things
---

To be useful, objects need to remember things. For example, a window needs to know its caption, its location on the screen, its width and its height.

Variables can be used to store data for both long and short term memory within your program’s code.

#### Variable

A **variable** is a programming artefact, and you can create variables where you want to remember a value. 

Each variable has a name (its identifier) that is used to identify it. The name should reflect the value that is being stored. For example, if you had a _name_ variable in the Window you would expect it to relate to the “name” of the window. 

Each variable stores a _single value_ of a certain **type**. The table lists the main basic types that are included in C#. The type can also be a class name, where you want to store a reference to an object of that class. 

| Kind of Data  | Type to Use  |
| -------------| ------------|
|Text data like “Hello World”       | `string`      |
| Single characters like ‘a’ or ‘b’      | `char`      |
| Whole numbers line 42 or 73    | `int`      |
| Read numbers like 3.1415 or 1.0   | `double`      |

Note that the built-in types in C# are all lowercase, while all other types will be PascalCase.

You can picture a variable like a box that contains a single value.

In memory, all variables store their data as a binary number. The type of the variable is used to give meaning to the data. An integer variable (int in C#) is a whole number.

#### Assignment statement
You use an **assignment statement** to _assign_ a value to a variable. This statement evaluates an expression, and stores the result in a variable. This will override any previous value stored there.  

Once you have stored a value in a variable, you can use the variable within an **expression** to read its _current_ value. 

The assignment statement gets the computer to perform two actions:

it evaluates the expression on the right of the assignment operator (the =) and stores this value in the variable on the left. For example, each of the following lines of code will assign the value 10 to the x variable.

```cs
    x = 10;
    x = 5 * 2;
    x = 2 + 4 * 2;
```

The expression can also use variables. For example, if we have an x and a y variable we could do: 

```cs
    x = 10;
    y = 2 * x;
    x = y + 5;
```

This runs over time. 

1. First, 10 is stored in x. 
1. In the second assignment statement, we calculate the expression `2 * x` (2 times x) giving 20, which is stored in y.
1. The final statement then calculates `y + 5`, giving 25, which is stored in x (overwriting the previous value). 

At the end of this code `x` would be storing 25 and `y` would be storing 20. 

The fact that this is two steps can help you understand how the following works. 

```cs
    x = x + 1; 
```

This evaluates the value of `x + 1`, and stores this in `x`. If the current value of `x` is 25, then the value would be 26 after this statement runs. 

As it is common to change the value of a variable by adding or removing something, there are a few shorthand ways to achieve this. You can use `+=` to add something to a variable, `-=` to subtract, and `++` to add one or `--` to subtract one. For example: 

```cs
    x++; // add one to x
    y--; // subtract one from y
    x += 10; // add 10 to x
    y -= x; // subtract the value of x from y
    y += 2 * x; // add the value of 2 times x to y
```

These short hand assignment operators perform the same actions as the standard assignment statement.
