Responsibility driven design helps provide a structured way to think about the objects in your solutions. Using this approach you can now start to think about designing your own programs.

Now you need to work through the week 6 tasks on [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au). You should aim to have these tasks all submitted before the end of the week. This will enable us to give you timely feedback, as well as ensuring you have plenty of time to get the tasks signed off or resubmit the tasks if needed.

Each task has a date, but the week 6 tasks start with “6.x”. Locate these tasks in your Task List and do your best to have them all complete before the end of the week.

The week 6 tasks will build upon previous weeks, allowing you to consolidate what you have learnt why you build your understanding of object design.

Also make sure you have finished off any of the remaining tasks from earlier weeks. You need to make sure these are Complete before moving on further.

Remember to make use of the discussion board if you need help. In the meantime, reflect on what we have covered and let us know what you think so far in the comments.
