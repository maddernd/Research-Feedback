Visual Studio Code has an extensive library of *Extensions* that let you add improved functionality for languages, debuggers, and tools to support your development workflow.  
Using extensions in VS Code will make it easier and faster to code with whatever language or tools you are using.

## C# Language Extensions

For **C#** code, we recommended that you install the `C#`, `C# Dev Kit` and `IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit` extensions.

:::tip[How do I install the C# extensions?]

2. Type "C#" in the Search bar at the top (shown in the blue box).
3. Click "Install" for each of the extensions listed (shown in the green box).

## C++ Language Extensions

For **C++** code, we recommended that you install the `C/C++` extension.  

You can also install the `C/C++ Extension Pack` extension which includes multiple extensions bundled together. If you have issues with syntax highlighting, the `Better C++ Syntax` extension is one of the best for this.
