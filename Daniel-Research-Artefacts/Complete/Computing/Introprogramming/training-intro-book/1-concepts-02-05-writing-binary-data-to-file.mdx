The `fwrite` function allows you to write binary data to a file. This requires you to pass a pointer to your data, as well as the size and number of elements you want written.

<a id="TableFwrite"></a>

|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Function Prototype** | `size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *destination)` |
| **Returns** | `int`: The number of elements written to the`destination` by `fwrite`. If this does not equal the `count` parameter it indicates an error occurred writing the data to the file. |
| **Parameter** | `ptr`: A pointer to the data to be saved to the file.<br/><br/>`size`: The size of each element to be saved<br/><br/>`count`: The number of elements to be saved to the file.<br/><br/>`destination`: The `FILE` to write the output to<br/><br/>|

:::note
- The file must be opened with write permissions. 
- This will write the binary data to file from the values pointed to by the `ptr` parameter.

```c
// Program write_binary.c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    FILE *out;

    int count = 3;
    double data[3] = { 73.98, 43.21, 3.1415 };

    out = fopen("data.bin", "wb");
    if(out == NULL) return 0;

    fwrite(&count, sizeof(int), 1, out); // write number of doubles
    fwrite(data, sizeof(double), 3, out; // write 3 doubles

    fclose(out);

    return 0;
}
