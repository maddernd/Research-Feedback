Learning to build software takes practice. The main this is not to get too overwhelmed with everything. One of the key strategies for overcoming this is to break problems down into parts. This is referred to as **problem decomposition**, and is the key to dealing with the complexities of software development.

Computer software is complicated, involving many parts working together to achieve desired results. Utilisation of **decomposition** is critical to helping us work effectively.

As you get started with this, make sure to approach things [iteratively](../../1-concepts/1-iterative-development). Do not try to do too much in any step. Get something simple working, then add a little, get it working, and repeat this until you achieve your goals.

:::tip
Make sure you have at least a pseudocode plan of you are aiming to implement. This could be in your head or written down. If you find yourself randomly changing the code to try to get it working, then stop and think. Maybe you have not fully understood some concepts, or you are generally stuck. Get some help by talking someone through your program and how you are intending it to work.
