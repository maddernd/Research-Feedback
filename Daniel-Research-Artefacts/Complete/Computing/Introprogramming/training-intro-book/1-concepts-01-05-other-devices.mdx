The input/output operations are fairly standardised across different device types. Saving data to a file is very similar to writing it to the Terminal or to a network. The skills you learn with any one of these will be transferable to other devices.

:::note

- The tasks you need to do to read and write data are similar, regardless of the destination device.
- Reading and writing to file is similar to reading and writing from the Terminal.
- You can open connections to other machines, and read and write data across these connections. Lookup details on sockets if you are interested in doing this.
