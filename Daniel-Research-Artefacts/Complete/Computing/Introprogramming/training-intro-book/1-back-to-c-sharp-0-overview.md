title: Overview
---

In Part 1 we started with the C# programming language so that we could focus on programs as instructions. When we started Part 2, we switched to C/C++ so that we could focus on programs as organised code. We did this because C# does not include the code structures we needed to explore. Now that we are starting Part 3 we understand how code and data can be organised in the computer, and we want to focus on object-oriented programming concepts.

The C++ language does provide object-oriented programming concepts, but will require you to focus on lower level ideas around how these structures are organised in memory. As a result, we have chosen this point to switch back to the C# language. As we saw when we switched from C# to C/C++ the control flow statements are basically the same, so this chapter will focus on the minimal concepts we need to pick up before we really start to focus on objects and object-oriented programming. Then in the next chapter we will re-introduce the other programming concepts we covered in C/C++ across Part 2, but in the new object-oriented way of thinking (paradigm).
