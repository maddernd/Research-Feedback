## Inheritance

Class inheritance uses the `:` to indicate which class it is inheriting from.

```cs
public class HeroCharacter : GameObject
```

Here we have `HeroCharacter` inheriting from a made up `GameObject` class.

## Virtual Methods

Using our GameObject/HeroCharacter example again, we can see the syntax which you can use to implement a virtual method.

Our `HeroCharacter` method overrides the `Area()` function in order to provide the correct implementation for a `HeroCharacter` object.

```cs
public class GameObject
{
  public virtual double Area()
  {
    return X * Y;
  }
}

public class HeroCharacter : GameObject
{
  public override double Area()
  {
    return X * Y - 50;
  }
}
```

## Abstract Keyword

The abstract modifier keyword is used to indicate that the thing being modified does not have an implementation, and that the class which overrides it should provide the implementation.

```cs
public abstract class Shape
```

```cs
abstract public int Area();
```

```cs
public abstract double Area
{
  get;
}
```
