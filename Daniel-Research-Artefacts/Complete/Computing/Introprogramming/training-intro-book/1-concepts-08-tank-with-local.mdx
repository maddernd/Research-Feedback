title: Creating a storage tank with local knowledge
---

You will create a storage tank and make use of local variables. These variables allow the object to have some short term memory when it is drawing itself to the screen. 

To get something started we need to declare a Storage Tank class, and add to it a Draw method. This can then be used within Main. You will use local variables to store and calculate the data you need to make the tank appear on the screen. 

## Your Task

What would happen if you created and drew multiple water tanks?
