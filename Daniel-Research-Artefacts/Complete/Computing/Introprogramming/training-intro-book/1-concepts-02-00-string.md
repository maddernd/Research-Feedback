title: String

Text is one place we have already been working with array. Think about it. Each string is a number of characters. The only way this is possible is if we are using an array. The C++ language added a special `string` type to make it easier to work with textual data. This has been good, as we have been able to use that up to now.

With C, there were no such niceties. In C, you have to create your own strings using arrays of characters.
