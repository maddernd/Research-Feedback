You can use`fprintf` to write data to a `FILE` that has been opened with write capabilities. This works the same as `printf` and `sprintf`.

| **Function Prototype** | `int fprintf(FILE *destination, const char *format, ...)` |
| **Returns** | `int`: The number of characters written to the `destination` by `fprintf`. |
| **Parameter** | `destination`: The `FILE` to write output into.<br/><br/>`format`: The text that is to be written to the file. This text may contain format tags to include other values. This is the same as <code>printf</code>, see Figure ?? for the syntax of the format tag.<br/><br/>`...`: Optional values, must have at least as many values as format tags.|
