The introduction of control flow has enabled us to start to moving from explicit instructions to more general instructions that use data. This is the start of our transition to building digital realities, where data and logic will come together as we are seeing here.

We have covered a lot of ground in this chapter. So take your time and really understand this as much as you can before you move on.

By now, the programs we are creating are getting difficult to work with. The next part of our journey will look at how we can organise the data and instructions within code to allow us to create larger and more complex programs.

Control flow will still perform a central role within these programs. So, you really need to understand how control flow works and how to make use of it as you go forward.
