Using interface inheritance, lambda expressions and delegates, you now have the ability to flexibly share functionality across unrelated types!

Now you need to work through the week 8 tasks on [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au). You should aim to have these tasks all submitted before the end of the week. This will enable us to give you timely feedback, as well as ensuring you have plenty of time to get the tasks signed off or resubmit the tasks if needed.

Each task has a date, but the week 8 tasks start with “8.x”. Locate these tasks in your Task List and do your best to have them all complete before the end of the week.

The week 8 tasks will get you to start working with interface inheritance, lambda expressions, and delegates!

Also make sure you have finished off any of the remaining tasks from earlier weeks. You need to make sure these are Complete before moving on further.
