title: Let's start making objects
---

So far you have learnt how to use objects that someone else has coded. This week you will focus on what you need to know in order to start making your own objects. 

Object oriented programming is about defining classes that describe what objects of that class will know and be able to do. You will explore the ideas of variables and methods and how these work to make objects.

Throughout this week you'll be asked to reflect on your own situation, participate in discussion and review and analyse relevant material. We wish you all the best and encourage you to actively participate.
