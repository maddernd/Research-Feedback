title: Communicating the Design
---

Read about how to best communicate your design ideas to others.

As you have seen, building software is challenging. Getting an unintelligent computer to do anything means you need to spell out everything, every little detail. So being able to effectively communicate how we think a solution should work is a really important skill. The key is to balance the details with the message.

There are several reasons why you may be documenting a design. When the program does not exist, a design can help multiple people work together to build the solution. To work effectively together, these people need to build a shared understanding of the structure of the program's solution. In these cases, the purpose of the design document is to help develop that shared vision, and to communicate key parts of the solution and how they will work.

If you already have the code for a program, then the design documentation has a different purpose. Here the aim is to communicate what exists, to enable others to quickly and easily understand how things work, and to help them work out where things are.

When aiming to document a design you need to know the purpose of the documentation. What is it that you are aiming to achieve? Once you know this you can start to plan what will go into the documentation.

In general, a design document will contain textual descriptions, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams. You will want to communicate details about the classes in the solution, their roles, and how they work together to achieve key goals. The art is to be able to do this in a way that communicates the important details. There are generally lots of details that can be covered, so finding just the right details to present will take time and effort. Here are some pointers for things to think about when you are documenting a design:

- A short paragraph (2 or 3 sentences) can be a great way of communicating the core aspects of a Role.
- Overview class diagrams can be useful to help people get a feel for the solution
- Ideally the names you assign responsibilities should communicate their purpose.
- Pick tricky or informative interactions to illustrate in sequence diagrams.
- Less is often better, focus on what you are aiming to communicate.
- In all cases, feel free to leave out details that are not important. 

Remember the aim is to communicate, not to present everything that is there all at once.


## Your Task

Consider what you would like to know when reviewing someone's object design. What information would you like to see?
