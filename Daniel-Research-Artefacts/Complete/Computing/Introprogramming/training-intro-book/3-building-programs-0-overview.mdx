The first two legs of our journey have taken us to two quite different sites: digital realities, and using the terminal and shell.
Our next step is to bring these together and see how we can use programming tools through the terminal and shell to build and run our own digital realities.

This final chapter of Part 0 will show you how to create a project, build and run a small program, and then watch the program running using a tool called the debugger.
Once you can use these tools, you will be equipped to venture ahead and learn about the things you can create within digital realities.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:

- Create a project using the dotnet tools, and describe what the project contains.
- Write and save provided source code using Visual Studio Code.
- Build and run a program using the dotnet command line tools.
- Run a program in the debugger, and step through its actions.
- Add SplashKit to a project to create graphical programs.

:::tip
You will need to use the tools in this chapter for all the other programs you build as you explore programming. Make sure you are confident with each of them as you move forward.
