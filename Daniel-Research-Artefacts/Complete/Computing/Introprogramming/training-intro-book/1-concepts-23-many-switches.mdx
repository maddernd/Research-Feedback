title: More the Merrier

Let's make thing more interesting with many lights and switches.

Now we have the lights and switches working, we can extend the simulator to work with multiple lights and multiple switches. This video will demonstrate how to get multiple objects working together, and show you how to handle optional collaborations.

After watching the video, consider the following points:

- C# throws an exception when you try to call a method on a variable that does not refer to an object.
- Objective C will do nothing or return 0, false, or null when you call a method on a variable that does not refer to an object.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches? Let us know in the comments.
