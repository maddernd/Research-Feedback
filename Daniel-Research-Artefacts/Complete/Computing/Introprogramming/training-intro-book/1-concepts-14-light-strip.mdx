title: Light Strip
---

Start working with Lists in order to add a light strip to our light simulator.

This video demonstrates the use of collection classes to implement a `LightStrip` that contains a number of `LightBulbs`. The strip can then be used to control access to the lights, handling user input to allow the user to switch them on and off individually, as well as providing convenient methods for toggling all of the lights, and turning them all on and off. Through this, see how to make use of the basic features of the C# `List` class along with the use of for loops to iterate over the elements within the list.

## Your Task

Reflect on the use of the list in the video. What other things could you do with the List to extend the `LightStrip` features?
