title: Encapsulation
---

Examine how encapsulation relates to object oriented programming. 

The [dictionary](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn) definition of *encapsulation* refers to "the condition of being enclosed (as in a capsule). "  This is essentially its relationship with object oriented programming.  

Imagine objects as being a capsule, within which we have created the ability to know and do things. This capsule has some aspects hidden from view, and  external accessible parts. These features are mirrored in objects through the use of *information hiding*. Class members (both static and instance members) have a *scope modifier* that determines who can access that member. 

*Public* members sit on the *public interface* to the class or object. *Private* members are hidden within the object and are only accessible within the class itself.

This allows us to expose only details that others need to have access to, while keeping implementation details hidden.

Encapsulation also enables us consider objects as having an *identity*. Each object is a unique capsule, with its knowledge and capabilities contained within itself.  

When you call *new* you are creating a new object. It exists, and has its own identity. When you tell it to do things, you are referring to that object specifically. 

## Your Task

Reflect on the idea of encapsulation and discuss why you think fields should be made private.
