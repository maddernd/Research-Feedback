The assignment statement allows you to store a value in a variable. This can now be extended to allow you to store a value in an element of an array. To achieve this, you indicate the array as well as the *index* of the element you want to store the value in.

<div class="caption">Assigning a value to an element of the array</div><br/>

:::note

- The assignment statement is an **instruction**, storing a value in a variable or array.
- When working with arrays, you can store a value in an element by specify the array and index of the element.
- You can code this in C/C++ using: `data[1] = 127.5 * 2;`. In this case, `data` is the name of the array variable, and 1 is the index of the second element. The code in the snippet stores a 255.0 in the second element of the data array.

## Example

The following example creates two arrays, and assigns values to their elements.

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    int data[4];

    data[0] = 10;
    data[1] = 72;
    data[2] = -1;
    data[3] = 0;

    point_2d points[3];

    points[0] = point_at(0, 0);
    points[1] = point_at(0.4, -10.1);
    points[2] = point_at(-1, 8.7);
}
```
