title: Overview

In Part 1, you were introduced to programming in C#. Then, in Part 2, you switched to C/C++. Then you moved back to C# in Part 3. By doing this you learned how code and data can be organised in a computer, and hopefully you started to notice that you could apply concepts form C# in C/C++ and vice versa. Some of the specific syntax might have been different, but the overarching concepts remained the same. Of course, that's because these languages all start with C, right? Not so! Welcome to the wild world of python, where the indentation defines code blocks and the type definitions don't matter (editors note: they still matter, Python is just more forgiving)!

This next chapter will introduce you to writing code in Python, specifically helping you to transition smoothly from your existing C flavoured knowledge to writing "Pythonic" code. Don't worry, you've already learned most of the essential skills for programming; adapting to Python will be more straightforward than you might expect!
