Adding in functions and procedures opens up opportunities to break up your program functionality. By decomposing this into smaller functions and procedures, you can build up large programs without needing to maintain all the logic in your head.

Instead, you can focus on each part in turn, and create the larger solution little by little. Where each part is its own isolated set of logic, allowing you to focus on just one part at a time.
