This chapter has introduced a number of new instructions, shown in the concept map below, that you can use in your code to create more dynamic programs. You now have a range of different tools to help you craft sequences of instructions to get the computer to do what you want.

Putting these together requires some computational thinking, as you now have the tools you need to design algorithms that achieve much more than you could with just simple sequences.
