title: Arrays and Collections
---

Computers are unintelligent, but capable to performing millions of simple instructions every second. To further empower our programs we need mechanisms to help us work with large amounts of data.

This week we focus on learning to use **arrays** and **collection** classes in order to work with lists of data, allowing us to process large volumes of data with very little code. The trick is to understand what arrays are, and to see how you can use them together with loops to achieve great things.

For help with syntax details, see this week's [syntax guide](../25-syntax-guide).

What are you looking forward to learning this week? Let us know in the comments.
