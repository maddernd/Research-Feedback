title: Share concept maps
---

One of the tasks this week asks you to draw up a visualisation (picture, poster, concept map, or similar) to show off what you have understood about objects. It would be great if once you have finished this task you could post up your work to the Discussion Board.

Focus on the key idea that objects know and can do things. See if you can bring in some of the associated concepts and terminology. Be creative.
