title: Overriding
---

Inheritance allows us to create a class that will _inherit_ all of the features of its _parent_ (or base) class. While this is great for most features, there are often things the child class will want to change.

Let's return to the Shape Drawing example. Previously we had both the `Ellipse` and the `Rectangle` inheriting a `Draw` method from the `Shape` class. This method drew the shape as a rectangle, so our ellipse objects were not working correctly!

To fix this we need to make a couple of changes:

1. We need to give child classes permission to change how `Draw` works. To do this we mark the `Draw` method as `virtual` in the `Shape` class.
1. Now we can `override` the `Draw` method in the `Ellipse` class. This can then draw itself as an ellipse.

```cs
public class Shape
{
    public Color Color {get; set;}
    public int X {get; set;}
    public int Y { get; set; }
    public int Width { get; set; }
    public int Height { get; set; }

    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        SplashKit.FillRectangle(Color, X, Y, Width, Height);
    }
}

public class Rectangle : Shape
{
}

public class Ellipse : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        SplashKit.FillEllipse(Color, X, Y, Width, Height);
    } 
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Rectangle r = new Rectangle();
        Ellipse e = new Ellipse();
        // ...

        r.Draw();
        e.Draw();
    }
}
``` 

When the above code is run the `Rectangle` will draw as a rectangle, and the `Ellipse` will draw as an ellipse. Why? Each object knows what it is, so when an `Ellipse` object is told to draw it uses the code from the `Ellipse`. Similarly, when a `Rectangle` is told to draw it runs the code from the `Rectangle` class which is this case has not changed the way `Draw` works, so the original code from `Shape` is run.

## Accessing the base class

Sometimes you want to _extend_ what happens when a method is called on a child class. In these cases you can call the inherited version of the method using the `base` keyword to access the method on the parent class. While it is unnecessary in this case, the following code does show you how you could do this in the `Rectangle` class. Here we override the `Draw` method and then have it explicitly call the `Draw` method on the base class (the version on the `Shape` class). As indicated in the comments, you could then add additional code around the call to the base class method as needed.

```cs
public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        // could do other things here.

        base.Draw(); // call draw from within Shape.

        // do more code here..
    } 
} 
``` 

## The Special Case with Constructors

Constructors are used to initialise objects when they are created. When you create a `Rectangle` object, it needs to initialise both the details from the `Rectangle` class and the aspects it inherited from the `Shape` class. When you only have a default constructor there is nothing special that you need to do, but if the parent class does not have a default constructor (one without parameters) then the child class must pass values up to its base class when it is initialised.

If we change the `Shape` class to have a constructor that has two parameters for the `x` and `y` location of the shape, then we also need to change the `Rectangle` and `Ellipse` classes to have constructors that will supply values for this constructor when rectangles and ellipses are created.

```cs
public class Shape
{
    public int X {get; set;}
    public int Y { get; set; }
    // ...

    public Shape(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }

    // ...
}
```

The following code shows the changes we can make to get this working for the `Rectangle` and `Ellipse` classes. Notice the use of the `:` operator after the declaration of the constructor. This signifies that when the object is created, it is initialised from the parent class down to the child class. So the `Shape` part needs to be initialised first. As a result, the call to the base class constructor happens _before_ the body of the child class's constructor.

In the following example, all `Rectangle` objects will pass `10` and `20` to the base class constructor's `x` and `y` parameters. Whereas the `Ellipse` also has two parameters (`x` and `y`) whose values are passes up to the base class constructor. Notice that `Ellipse` doesn't do anything with these parameters in its constructor, in this case the values are only used to pass to the constructor in `Shape`.

```cs
public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public Rectangle() : base ( 10, 20 )
    {
    }
}

public class Ellipse : Shape
{
    public Ellipse(int x, int y) : base ( x, y )
    {
    }
    
    // ...
}
```
