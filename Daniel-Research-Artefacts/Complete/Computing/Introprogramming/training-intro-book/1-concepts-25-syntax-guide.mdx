## Array Declaration

The [] brackets go after the type, to indicate that we have an array of the preceding type.

```cs
int[] values;
string[] names;
```

## Array Initialisation

We can initialise our arrays when we declare them with the following syntax:
```cs
int[] temperatures = new int[5];
int[] temperatures = new int[3] { 22, 23, 24 };
string[] names = new string[3] { "Steven", "Alex", "Andrew" };
```

<div class="caption">This diagram shows the syntax for an array declaration and initialisation in C#.</div><br/>

:::note
Note that values or expressions must all be of a type which matches the type of array. Above, our int array of temperatures stores 22, 23, 24 (all integers).

## Accessing values in an array

We can access individual values in our arrays with the following syntax:

```cs
int[] temperatures = new int[3] { 22, 23, 24 };

temperatures[2];

int i = 3;
temperatures[i]
temperatures[i + 2]
```

## For Loops

<img src={imgArrayForLoop.src} alt="This diagram shows the syntax for a for loop in C#." width="100%" />
<div class="caption">This diagram shows the syntax for a for loop in C#.</div><br/>

The for loop is most often constructed with the following components which are separated by a semicolon ; in the brackets:

- **init** - runs once before the loop starts.
- **while** - the condition of the loop, checked each iteration.
- **post loop action** - runs at the end of each loop.
 
The for loop in the following code initialises an `i` *index* variable, and loops while `i < temperatures.Length`, adding 1 to i at the end of each loop.

```cs
int[] temperatures = { 22, 22, 23, 24, 24, 22 };
for ( int i; i < temperatures.Length; i++ )
{
   Console.WriteLine(temperatures[i]);
}

int i = 0;
while (i < temperatures.Length;)
{
   Console.WriteLine(temperatures[i]);
   i++;
}
```

:::note
The for and while loops in the examples above are equivalent.

## Generics

Generics are used when a class needs to use or manage objects of some type, where the specifics of the type will be provided by the user of the class. For example the *List* class needs us to specify what type we want to store in the list. This way, the List class can store lists of *any* type!

```cs
List<int> list1;
List<string> names;
List<decimal> prices;
List<SpaceShip> ships;
```

Generics are specified with the syntax `List<T>`, where `<T>` represents the position we specify the type. Wherever you see a `<T>`, it is the placeholder for a type.

You can also initialise lists with array contents as shown below. More details from [msdn](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384062.aspx).

## foreach loop:

foreach loops are a handy way for us to more easily loop over arrays and lists. They handle the index variable for us, and are an alternative syntax to for loops.

:::Note
Sometimes you still want an index variable, so you could use a for loop wherever you can use a foreach loop.

import imgArrayForEachLoop from './images/arrays-foreach-loops.png';

<a id="FigureArrayForEachLoop"></a>
<img src={imgArrayForEachLoop.src} alt="This diagram shows the syntax for a foreach loop in C#." width="100%" />
<div class="caption">This diagram shows the syntax for a foreach loop in C#.</div><br/>

```cs
int[] temperatures = { 22, 22, 23, 24, 24, 22 };
foreach (int temp in temperatures)
{
   Console.WriteLine(temp);
}
```

A foreach loop is constructed with the following components:

- A type (`int`) is the type of element in your array or list.
- the `temp` is the name of the variable used in the loop, equivalent to `temperatures[i]`
- the name of the array/list: in `temperatures`.

*For more advanced array concepts, we can have 2 dimensional arrays:*
```cs
string[,] names;
```

And jagged 2D arrays:

```cs
int[][] values;
```
