Object oriented programming is about designing objects that know and can do things. This week you have explored adding fields, methods, properties, and constructors to our objects. 

In the next course you will see how to make these objects do more by adding statements that make your programs more dynamic. 

### Your Task

Now you need to work through the week 2 tasks on [OnTrack](https://ontrack.deakin.edu.au). You should aim to have these tasks submitted before the end of the week. This will enable us to give you timely feedback, as well as ensuring you have plenty of time to get the tasks signed off or resubmit the tasks if needed. 

The week 2 tasks start with “**2.**x”. Locate these tasks in your Task List.

The week 2 tasks will get you to start designing and building your own objects.

Make sure you have finished week 1 tasks. You need to make sure these are Complete.

For some help with syntax details, see this week's [syntax guide](../16-syntax-guide).

Remember to make use of the discussion board if you need help. In the meantime, reflect on what we have covered and let us know what you think so far in the comments.
