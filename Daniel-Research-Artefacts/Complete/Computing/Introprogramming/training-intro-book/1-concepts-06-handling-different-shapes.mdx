title: Handling different shapes
---

See how we go through designing a Shape Drawing program which can handle multiple shapes.

Explore the process of extending the UML digram of Shape Drawing in order to handle multiple shapes through the use of inheritance, and how to implement these changes in C#.

## Shapes and Polymorphism

Watch as we revisit the shape drawing program, in order to see how to make use of polymorphism.

See how to extend the shape drawing program in order to make use of polymorphism, with easy drawing for many kinds of shapes. Take note of how this concept can help us reduce code duplication and increase code quality!

## Making Shapes Abstract

Watch as we revisit the shape drawing program, in order to make use of abstract classes and methods.

See how to modify the shape drawing program in order to make use of abstract classes and methods. Making `Shape` abstract and include an abstract `Draw` method to allow us to finish off the design for this program.
