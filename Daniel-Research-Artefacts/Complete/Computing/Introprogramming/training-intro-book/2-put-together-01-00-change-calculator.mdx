title: Change Calculator
---

For this exercise we want to build a terminal program to calculate and output the ideal change for a given transaction in a vending machine. In designing this program, we will make use of the concepts introduced in this chapter. We will use:

* [variables](../../1-concepts/07-variable) to store values such as the amount paid,
* [constants](../../1-concepts/07-variable#constants) for the values of the different coins, and
* [instructions](../../1-concepts/00-program) to calculate and output the change expected.

To design and implement this program we need to follow a number of steps:

1. Understand the problem, and the steps the computer needs to perform.
2. Choose the building blocks we will create and use, and design the steps needed to achieve our goals.
3. Map these steps to building blocks and instructions to code.
4. Compile, run, and test the program.

Let's start by understanding what the program needs to do. This will involve determining the tasks to be performed, the steps involved in those tasks, and any data associated with them. Only then can you start building a solution.

## Understand the problem

To build a program we need to code the sequence of instructions that will get the computer to perform the actions we want. As the computer is unintelligent, this requires us to fully understand the problem and the steps needed to achieve the required outcomes. This makes it really important to start by understanding what you want the program to do.

In this first step, your goal is to understand the task as fully as possible. As you think through this you need to keep in mind what the computer can do, and try to think about this in terms of the steps we will need the computer to perform.

## Choose building blocks

Once you know what you want to build, the next step involves working out how you will put together the different programming concepts so that you can get the computer to achieve the tasks you need. At the end of this, you should have a structure in mind and a plan for how the program will come together.

## Writing the code

At this point you should have a good idea for how the program will work, and you now need to convert those ideas to code. This is where you can use the syntax and examples covered in the concepts' section to work out how to capture your ideas in code.

## Testing your program

Once you have the code written, you need to test that it actually achieves the results you aim for. At this step you compile, and run your program, and try different inputs to see how it behaves. Really testing your program will involve checking it does what you expect, but also checking that it behaves when you do unexpected things with the input.

Let's go through these steps now with the change calculator in mind.
