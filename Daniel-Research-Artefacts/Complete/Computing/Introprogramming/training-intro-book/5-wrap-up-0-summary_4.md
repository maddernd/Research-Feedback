title: Summary

This chapter introduced a number of concepts related to working with multiple values in code. Central to this has been the array, and the use of expressions to access elements within that array.

Mastering these concepts will take time, but it will be worth the effort. Once you really understand this, you will be able to create code that uses arrays to easily manage multiple values.

Now that we have arrays we can work with many values, but we are limited in the number we can load and work with at any time. Data allocated on the stack has to have a fixed size, and there is only a small amount of stack space available. To break free of these constraints we need to look to other spaces in memory, and interacting with the operating system to start manually working with memory allocations.

:::note

- The central concept of this chapter is the **Array**. An array is a variable that can store multiple values.
- When you work with arrays make any logic you want to apply to *all elements* will be coded using **for each** element and the **For Loop**.
- **Strings** are arrays of characters, and can be used to store textual data in your code
