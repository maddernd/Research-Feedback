There is no need to spend too long on this chapter. As you have seen, the changes to switch at this point are relatively small. Make sure you can get some of your old programs working, and familiarise yourself with the build and run process.

You want to leave this chapter feeling that you can apply what you have learnt about control flow, sequence, and data in this new language.
