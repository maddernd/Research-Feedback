See how to use arrays and loops to quickly process lots of data.

In this video we work through the development of a small program that works with an array of values. See how arrays help to simplify working with lots of data, move from individual variables to an array. End with a look at using loops to process the data. 

[Download](/resources/code-examples/part-2/5-working-with-multiples/manipulating-arrays/ManipulatingArrays.zip) the code and resources used in this video.
