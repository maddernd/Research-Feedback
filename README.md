# Project Setup Guide

Welcome to the setup guide for your project. This guide will walk you through installing and using the project step-by-step, ensuring a smooth setup process. The project uses **Olama** and **Hugging Face**, so we'll also cover their setup and integration.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python 3.10 or later** (You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Git** (You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/))
- **Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended for managing dependencies)
- **CUDA** (For GPU support, if available)
- **Hugging Face API Key** (Create an account at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) and get your API key)

### Installing Python

If you don't have Python installed, you can follow these steps:

1. Visit [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download and install the latest stable version (ensure it's 3.10 or above).
3. Verify installation by running:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

## Project Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/maddernd/private-gpt>
cd <project-directory>
### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Setting up a virtual environment helps isolate the project dependencies:

1. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

3. Verify that the virtual environment is active by checking the Python version:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

### Step 3: Install the Required Dependencies

With the virtual environment active (if you set one up), install the required Python packages:

1. Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. If using **CUDA** for GPU support, make sure to install the appropriate version of PyTorch:

    ```bash
    pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
    ```

### Step 4: Hugging Face and Olama Setup

This project uses models from Hugging Face, so you will need to set up your Hugging Face account and API key.

1. **Sign up at Hugging Face:**

   If you don't already have an account, sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join).

2. **Obtain your Hugging Face API Key:**

   - Go to your account settings on Hugging Face.
   - Generate and copy your API key.

3. **Configure your Hugging Face API key in the project:**

   Run the following command to authenticate:

    ```bash
    huggingface-cli login
    ```

    Paste your API key when prompted.

4. **Set up Olama:**

   - Follow the instructions on the [Olama documentation](https://docs.olama.ai/getting-started/) to install and configure Olama for this project.
   
   Example installation:

    ```bash
    pip install olama
    ```

### Step 5: Running the Project

Now that everything is set up, you can run the project.

1. To start the project, run the following command:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. If the project involves running specific tasks like model training or data preprocessing, refer to the README or internal documentation for task-specific commands.

### Step 6: Using the Hugging Face Model

The project pulls models from Hugging Face. To use them within your code:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("model-name")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("model-name")
### Step 7: Environment Variables

Some configurations, like API keys or project-specific settings, may need environment variables to be set up.

1. **Create a `.env` file in the project root** (if it doesn’t already exist).
2. **Add your keys and settings** in the following format:

    ```bash
    HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_hugging_face_api_key
    OLAMA_API_KEY=your_olama_api_key
    OTHER_ENV_VARIABLE=some_value
    ```

3. **Load the environment variables in your project**:

   In your Python code, you can load the `.env` file using the `dotenv` package:

    ```python
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    import os

    load_dotenv()

    huggingface_api_key = os.getenv("HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY")
    olama_api_key = os.getenv("OLAMA_API_KEY")
    ```

Make sure to keep this file secure and never commit it to version control.

### Step 8: Testing the Project

You can run tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

1. **Run the tests** using the `pytest` framework:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

2. **Check the test coverage** to ensure all parts of your code are covered by tests:

    ```bash
    pytest --cov=your_project_name
    ```

   If any tests fail, review the logs and make the necessary fixes before proceeding.

### Step 9: Further Configuration

For additional customization or configuration:

1. **Review the `config` files** located in the project directory. These files usually control settings like model parameters, training configurations, and other options specific to the project.

2. **Update configuration settings** as needed. For example, you can modify hyperparameters for training models, such as learning rates or batch sizes, by editing the configuration files.

3. **Ensure compatibility with Hugging Face models**. If the project uses a specific model, you can load it by specifying the correct model name in the configuration:

    ```yaml
    model:
      name: "bert-base-uncased"
    ```

4. **Integrate with Olama** for real-time inference if applicable. Refer to the [Olama documentation](https://docs.olama.ai/) for integration details.

### Step 10: Running the Project

Once the project is set up and tested, you can run it for your intended use case:

1. **To start the project**, use the main script or entry point defined in your project:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **If there are specific tasks** (e.g., training a model, running inference, or preprocessing data), refer to the project’s README or documentation for task-specific commands.

3. **Monitor the logs** during execution to ensure that the project is running as expected. You may also want to set up logging for debugging and tracking the output.

### Step 11: Deploying the Project (Optional)

If you wish to deploy the project for production use:

1. **Choose a cloud provider** or platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or Hugging Face Inference API).

2. **Containerize the project** using Docker if required:

    ```bash
    docker build -t your_project_image .
    docker run -p 8000:8000 your_project_image
    ```

3. **Deploy the container** or code to the platform of your choice. Follow the provider's specific instructions for deployment.

## Conclusion

You’ve now successfully set up, configured, and tested the project using **Olama** and **Hugging Face**. You can now run, develop, and deploy your project.
